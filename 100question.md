### **Java Interview Questions & Answers**  

**1. Class Loader**  
A **ClassLoader** in Java is responsible for loading class files into memory during runtime. There are three main types:  
- **Bootstrap ClassLoader**  
- **Extension ClassLoader**  
- **Application ClassLoader**
- 
  ### **Types of ClassLoaders in Java**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bootstrap ClassLoader**  
   - **Loads core Java classes** (from `rt.jar` like `java.lang.*`, `java.util.*`).  
   - **Parent of all class loaders** but has **no parent itself**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Extension ClassLoader**  
   - Loads classes from the **`ext`** directory (`$JAVA_HOME/lib/ext`).  
   - Loads **Java extensions** (like security-related classes).  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Application ClassLoader (System ClassLoader)**  
   - Loads classes from the **classpath** (`CLASSPATH` environment variable, default is the current directory).  
   - Loads user-defined classes (our Java application classes).

**2. Heap Area - Objects get created here.**  
The **Heap Area** is a memory space where objects are dynamically allocated during runtime.  

**3. Class Area - or Static Pool - All the static members get stored here.**  
The **Class Area** stores class definitions, method metadata, and **static variables**.  

**4. Stack - Execution happens inside stack.**  
The **Stack** stores method execution details, including **local variables, method calls, and references**.  

**5. Method Area - Implementation of methods is stored here.**  
The **Method Area** holds method definitions, bytecode, and runtime constant pool data.  

**6. Native Area**  
The **Native Area** is used for executing native (non-Java) code via the Java Native Interface (JNI).  

---

**7. Difference Between Method Execution and Method Implementation**  
- **Method Execution**: The process of running a method, managed by the JVM execution stack.  
- **Method Implementation**: The actual code inside the method, defining its behavior.  

---

**8. Purpose of `super` keyword**  
The `super` keyword in Java is used to **refer to the immediate parent class**, allowing access to parent methods, constructors, and variables.  

---

**9. Explain Constructor Chaining**  
Constructor chaining allows calling one constructor from another within the same class (using `this()`) or from a parent class (using `super()`).  

- **Within the same class:**  
  ```java
  class A {
      A() {  
          this(10);  
          System.out.println("Default Constructor");
      }
      A(int x) {  
          System.out.println("Parameterized Constructor: " + x);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Between Parent and Child Class:**  
  ```java
  class Parent {
      Parent() {  
          System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
      }
  }
  class Child extends Parent {
      Child() {  
          super();  
          System.out.println("Child Constructor");
      }
  }
  ```

---

**10. What is a constructor? (1 sentence)**  
A **constructor** is a special method that initializes objects when an instance of a class is created.  

---

**11. How to achieve abstraction?**  
Abstraction in Java is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**, which hide implementation details while exposing only essential functionalities.  

---

**12. Purpose of `static` keyword**  
The `static` keyword is used to define **class-level variables and methods** that are shared across all instances of the class.  

---

**13. What is a static method?**  
A **static method** belongs to the class rather than instances of the class and can be called without creating an object.  
```java
class Utility {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static Method Called");
    }
}
Utility.display();  // No object creation needed
```

---

**14. Use `super` keyword with a method**  
The `super` keyword is used to call a **parent class method** from a child class.  
```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent Method");
    }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        super.display();  // Calls Parent's method
        System.out.println("Child Method");
    }
}
```

---

**15. Purpose of `final` keyword**  
The `final` keyword is used to **prevent modifications**:  
- **Final Variables** ‚Üí Cannot be reassigned.  
- **Final Methods** ‚Üí Cannot be overridden.  
- **Final Classes** ‚Üí Cannot be inherited.  

---

**16. Default vs Parameterized Constructors**  
- **Default Constructor**: A constructor **without parameters**, initializing objects with default values.  
- **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor **with parameters**, allowing custom initialization.  

Example:  
```java
class Car {
    int speed;
    String color;

    // Default Constructor
    Car() {
        speed = 0;
        color = "Unknown";
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Car(int speed, String color) {
        this.speed = speed;
        this.color = color;
    }
}
```

---

**17. What is a package? (1 sentence)**  
A **package** in Java is a way to organize related classes and interfaces together, helping in avoiding class name duplication and providing better access control.  

---

**18. How to import packages? (Syntax example)**  
```java
import packageName.ClassName;
```

---

**19. Purpose of `import` (1 sentence)**  
The `import` statement allows access to classes and interfaces from other packages in the current class.  

---

**20. What is an interface? (1 sentence)**  
An **interface** is a blueprint for classes that defines abstract methods (methods without a body) and is used for achieving abstraction and multiple inheritance.  

---

**21. Can you implement multiple interfaces? (Yes, with example)**  
Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces.  
```java
interface A {
    void methodA();
}
interface B {
    void methodB();
}
class C implements A, B {
    public void methodA() { System.out.println("Method A"); }
    public void methodB() { System.out.println("Method B"); }
}
```

---

**22. What is an abstract class? (1 sentence)**  
An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and may have abstract methods that need to be implemented by subclasses.  

---

**23. Types of Variables in Java**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Local Variable** ‚Äì Declared inside a method, exists only within it.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Instance Variable** ‚Äì Declared inside a class but outside methods, belongs to an object.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Static Variable** ‚Äì Declared with `static`, shared among all objects of the class.  

---

**24. Difference Between Local, Instance, and Static Variables**  

| Type        | Scope                     | Lifetime |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Local      | Inside a method/block     | Until method execution ends |
| Instance   | Inside a class (no `static`) | As long as the object exists |
| Static     | Inside a class (`static`) | Exists throughout the program |

---

**25. Declare and Initialize Variables (Examples):**  
```java
class Example {
    int instanceVar = 10;      // Instance Variable
    static int staticVar = 20; // Static Variable

    void method() {
        int localVar = 30;      // Local Variable
        System.out.println(localVar);
    }
}
```

---

**26. Purpose of `volatile`**  
‚úÖ Ensures all **threads** always see the **latest value** of a variable.  
```java
volatile int sharedVar; // Always read from main memory
```

---

**27. Purpose of `transient`**  
‚úÖ Stops a variable from being **saved during serialization**.  
```java
class Example implements Serializable {
    transient int skipVar; // Will not be saved
}
```
