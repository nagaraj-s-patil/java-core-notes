# Chapter 1: Introduction  

## What is Java?  
Java is an **object-oriented** programming language similar to C++, but easier and more advanced. It is **free to access** and runs on **all platforms**.  

## Key Features:  
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**  
- **Platform Independent**  
- **Robust, Scalable, and Portable**  
- **Supports Integration with Technologies** like Spring, Node.js, Android, Hadoop, J2EE  
- **Promotes Testing & CI/CD** using tools like Selenium  

## History of Java:  
- Developed by **James Gosling** and team at **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990s  
- Initially called **Project Oak**  
- Renamed **Java** after an espresso bean  
- **First release:** Java 1.0 in **1995**  
- **Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems** on **January 27, 2010**  
- The latest version (as of 2019) is **Java 12**  

## Real-World Example:  
Java is like a universal remote control, working on any device without modification.

# Features of Java

## 1. Simple  
Java removes complexities like pointers and operator overloading seen in C++, making it easier to use.  

## 2. Portable  
Java is **platform-independent**, meaning applications written on one platform can be easily moved to another.  

## 3. Object-Oriented  
Everything in Java is treated as an **object** with state and behavior, allowing for modular and reusable code.  

## 4. Dynamic  
Java supports **dynamic memory allocation**, reducing memory wastage and improving performance.  

## 5. Robust  
Java has strong **memory management** and eliminates errors through compile-time and runtime checking.  

## 6. Interpreted  
Java is compiled into **bytecode**, which is interpreted by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  

## 7. Multithreaded  
Java allows multiple **threads** to run concurrently, making applications more interactive and responsive.  

## 8. Platform Independent  
Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  
Thus, Java follows the principle: **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"**.  

## 9. Secure  
Java has built-in **security features** like static type-checking and runtime security management to prevent unauthorized access.

# 1.1 Software  

Software is an **automated version** of manual work. It provides **solutions** for real-world problems.  
Software typically contains **Programs, UI Components, and Storage Components**.  

## 1.1.1 Program  
A **program** is a set of instructions given to **hardware or a platform** for execution.  

### Platform  
A **platform** is a combination of a **processor** and an **operating system**.  
**Examples:** Windows, Linux, Android, etc.  

## Java and Platform Independence  
Java is **platform-independent**, meaning that applications or programs developed using Java can work on different platforms without modification.

 # 1.3 Object Orientation  

## Object  
An **Object** is a real-world physical entity.  
Anything with a physical presence or appearance is considered an **Object**.  
An Object has **States** and **Behavior**.  

### 1.3.1 State  
The **State** of an Object represents its properties, features, or data that describe what an Object is.  

**State → Information / Data → Variable (Data-Member)**  

### 1.3.2 Behavior  
The **Behavior** of an Object represents the actions or work performed by an Object.  

**Behavior → Action / Work → Method**  

#### Example: **Mobile Object**  
- **States**: Model, Color, Price, RAM, Storage, etc.  
- **Behavior**: `call()`, `sendSms()`  

In programming, the **State** of an Object is called a **Variable (Data Member)**, and the **Behavior** is called a **Method**.  

---

# 1.4 Class  

A **Class** is a logical entity or blueprint used to create multiple Objects.  

- We **cannot** create an Object without a Class.  
- **Step 1**: Create a Class → **Step 2**: Create Objects from it.  
- Multiple Objects created using the same Class are called **Similar Objects** or **Identical Objects**.  
- Each Object works **independently**; modifying or destroying one Object does not affect another.  

# 1.5 Keywords or Reserved Words  

Java has predefined **keywords** (also called **reserved words**) that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.  

### Common Java Keywords:  
`class`, `interface`, `abstract`, `import`, `package`, `static`, `public`, `private`, `protected`, `default`, `super`,  
`this`, `extends`, `implements`, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `break`, `continue`, `int`, `double`, `float`, `if`, `else`,  
`switch`, etc.  

### Example for `class`:  

#### **Bike.java**  
```java
class Bike {  
}  
```
