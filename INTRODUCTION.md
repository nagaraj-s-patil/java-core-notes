# Chapter 1: Introduction  

## What is Java?  
Java is an **object-oriented** programming language similar to C++, but easier and more advanced. It is **free to access** and runs on **all platforms**.  

## Key Features:  
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**  
- **Platform Independent**  
- **Robust, Scalable, and Portable**  
- **Supports Integration with Technologies** like Spring, Node.js, Android, Hadoop, J2EE  
- **Promotes Testing & CI/CD** using tools like Selenium  

## History of Java:  
- Developed by **James Gosling** and team at **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990s  
- Initially called **Project Oak**  
- Renamed **Java** after an espresso bean  
- **First release:** Java 1.0 in **1995**  
- **Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems** on **January 27, 2010**  
- The latest version (as of 2019) is **Java 12**  

## Real-World Example:  
Java is like a universal remote control, working on any device without modification.

# Features of Java

## 1. Simple  
Java removes complexities like pointers and operator overloading seen in C++, making it easier to use.  

## 2. Portable  
Java is **platform-independent**, meaning applications written on one platform can be easily moved to another.  

## 3. Object-Oriented  
Everything in Java is treated as an **object** with state and behavior, allowing for modular and reusable code.  

## 4. Dynamic  
Java supports **dynamic memory allocation**, reducing memory wastage and improving performance.  

## 5. Robust  
Java has strong **memory management** and eliminates errors through compile-time and runtime checking.  

## 6. Interpreted  
Java is compiled into **bytecode**, which is interpreted by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  

## 7. Multithreaded  
Java allows multiple **threads** to run concurrently, making applications more interactive and responsive.  

## 8. Platform Independent  
Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  
Thus, Java follows the principle: **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"**.  

## 9. Secure  
Java has built-in **security features** like static type-checking and runtime security management to prevent unauthorized access.
