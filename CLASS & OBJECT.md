# **Class & Object in Java**  

## **1. Class**  
- A **class** is a **blueprint** used to create multiple objects.  
- **Objects cannot be created without a class**.  
- Objects created from the **same class** are called **similar or identical objects**.  
- Each object works **independently** (modifying one object does not affect another).  

### **Example of a Class:**  
```java
class Movie {  
    Movie() {  // Constructor (same name as class)  
        System.out.println("Movie Object Created");  
    }  
}
```

## **2. Object**  
- An **object** is a **real-world physical entity**.  
- Anything with **physical presence** is an object.  
- Objects have **state (data) and behavior (methods)**.  

### **Example of an Object:**  
```java
class Product {  
    Product() {  // Constructor  
        System.out.println("Product Object Created");  
    }  
}

public class Main {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Product p1 = new Product();  // Object creation  
    }  
}  
```
**Output:**  
```
Product Object Created
```

## **3. Memory Management in Java**  
- **Objects are stored in Heap Memory**.  
- **JVM manages memory allocation and deallocation automatically**.  
- Objects are created in **heap memory** using the `new` keyword.  

### **Example:**  
```java
Product p1 = new Product();  // JVM stores p1 in heap memory
```

### **Object Address:**  
- The memory address of an object is represented in **Hexadecimal format**.  

```java
System.out.println(p1);  // Prints memory address
```

---

## **4. Constructor in Java**  
- After compilation, **Java automatically generates a default constructor**.  
- A **constructor name must be the same as the class name**.  

### **Example of Constructor:**  
```java
class Car {  
    Car() {  // Constructor  
        System.out.println("Car Object Created");  
    }  
}
```

## **5. Key Points**  
✅ A **class** is a logical entity (blueprint).  
✅ An **object** is a real-world entity (instance of a class).  
✅ **Memory allocation & deallocation** is handled by JVM.  
✅ **Objects are created in Heap Memory** using the `new` keyword.  
✅ **Constructors have the same name as the class and initialize objects.**
